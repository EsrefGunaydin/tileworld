              never wear on the floors and back surfaces. You can double the classic look with some
              extra items. However, of course, if you want a modern look, this is also an option.

              Most of the models used are not used again after they have become popular from time to
              time. However, this is not the case for subway tiles. The classic look is always
              preferred and doesn't bore anyone. If you are building a bathroom or kitchen to use
              for many years, the subway tile will suit you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thanks to its rectangular structure, it is also very suitable for constantly wet
              areas. A large surface area copes with the liquid more easily. Simultaneously, the
              distance between the tiles is fragile, and therefore, it is not affected by water.
              There is very little space for water to enter. Subway tile backsplash and subway tile
              shower will be highly logical because these areas contain too much liquid and
              moisture.

              it reflects much more light than other shapes. Especially choosing white colors will
              not regret you in this sense. Glass tiles, on the other hand, can double the
              brightness.
            </li>
            <li>
